## Installing

This is a simple web application, designed to be run on an apache-web server (or any 
reasonable HTTP server, really). An easy was to start up a web server for this locally
(assuming you have `python` installed) is to run the following command in the root
directory of this project.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

You can then go to `localhost:8000` in your browser to play it.
